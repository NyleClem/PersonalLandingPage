          This video shows Ray Lewis explaining why the lion is the king of the
          jungle. The lion isn't the biggest, fastest, or strongest animal-yet
          he rules over them all.The difference is mentality.The lion sees every
          challenge with confidence and dominance and that mindset turns him
          into a leader.This example reminds us that success in life isn't just
          about natural gifts, but about how you think, act, and believe in
          yourself.
